# Accounting Group and Administration

## Accounting Groups

Every Bunya user is required to be in a Bunya accounting group and every Bunya user should be in one accounting group only. 

Bunya users are usually added to accounting groups by their supervisor, group leader or groups administrator.

Users then need to use the associated accounting string to use with the `--account=AccountString` option when submitting jobs on Bunya.

All accounting strings start with `a_`.

## Finding accounting strings

Once a Bunya user has been added to an accounting group they should start a new login to Bunya and type the command `groups` on the command line. The accounting string is the one starting with `a_`.

New Bunya users in accounting groups are added once an hour to Slurm on Bunya, so it might take about 1 hour before a Bunya user can successfully submit a job on Bunya after beeing added to an accounting group.

## Aministration

Accounting group owners and accounting group administrators can add users to and remove users from the accounting group.
