## What is Globus ?

Globus is ...

## What are the limitations and risks ?

Currently, our UQ Globus endpoint does not support encrypted transfers. UQ RCC are addressing this.
All data transferred into/out of UQ Globus endpoint is *NOT* encrypted.

## How to get an RDM "Q" storage allocation connected to UQ Globus Service ?

There is a process we will walk you through. Please email rcc-support@uq.edu.au to have your Q storage allocation connected to Globus. Note that you must be the owner of the RDM storage collection record that contains the "Q" data storage allocation. 

## Basic Globus Usage

### Overview

The Globus web interface is the primary method of access.
It allows you to move files and folders between sites.
It also allows you to download files to your local computer (or a network drive attached to that local computer)

### Registering to use Globus

Anyone with a AAF OrcID etc credential can apply for access to an endpoint.

We do that in the process of connecting

If you are connecting to globus to pull data from a collaborator's Globus endpoint to your local machine, and you won't have your RDM storage allocation connected directly to GLous, then you will need to be manually registered to access the Globus endpoint. Again an email to rcc-support@uq.edu.au will sort that out.

### Getting at the endpoint

Visit https://app.globus.org/endpoints

Login with your institutional credentials

If you don't land in the UQ endpoint automatically, search for "The University of Queensland"
