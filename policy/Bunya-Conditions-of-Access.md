## Bunya Conditions of Access
dated 2025-03-28 

**By accessing Bunya a user agrees to the below terms of conditions of access.**

The terms in this form determine the basic understanding of a user (new or experienced) of the provided file systems and job submission system on University of Queensland owned and operated HPCs such as Bunya. 

* I understand that a basic knowledge of Unix is required to use HPC efficiently. An introduction to basic Unix commands is provided in Set 3 of https://www.qcif.edu.au/training/hpc-training-resources 

* I understand that I should make reasonable effort to learn about Bunya and its efficient and appropriate usage before running calculations on Bunya. A basic Unix and HPC introduction are provided via short videos through the https://www.qcif.edu.au/training/hpc-training-resources. The Bunya User Guide can be found here https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs 

* I understand that calculations and resource intensive processes, no matter how quick or small, should not be run on the login nodes. This includes software environment installations (conda, python and R) and compilation (Easybuild, make, cmake etc). They must be run via the queue submission system as a batch or interactive job. 

* I understand that I can use an interactive job submission to run calculations or software installations from the command line and interact with the calculation or software installation if required. 

* I understand that the space provided to me in /scratch/user is for data of current calculations only. It is not backed up. File expiry might be implemented in the future, and it should not be used to store data. 

* I understand that the space provided to me in /home is not backed up. 

* I understand that the space provided to me in /QRISdata via the RDM is hierarchical storage including fast disk, slow disk and tape. I understand the implications this will have on access to data in /QRISdata. An overview of RDM usage via HPC is provided via https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs/blob/main/guides/Bunya-UserData-Guide.md#qrisdata. 

* I understand that I should not be running/submitting calculations directly from a directory/folder in /QRISdata. 

* I understand that I should not be continuously reading from and/or writing to a directory/folder in /QRISdata during a calculation. Once-off read of input and/or once-off write of output is acceptable. 

* I understand that Bunya is for academic use only. Commercial and/or consultation work should not be using Bunya.

* I understand that unless personal use is explicitly allowed, software or data licensed to UQ, which includes Open-Source licensed software or data, must only be used for purposes legitimately associated with UQ's operations as a teaching and research institution. By obtaining or using UQ-licensed software or data I must understand and comply with the terms and conditions for use of the software or data. 

* ***I understand that if I run calculations or processes on the login nodes without an acceptable reason, or that if I submit my calculations from /QRISdata, or that if my calculations continuously write to and/or read from /QRISdata, or if I use Bunya for commercial and/or consultation work my access to Bunya could be suspended.***
