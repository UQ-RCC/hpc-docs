## Bunya Conditions of Access
dated 2025-11-10 

**By accessing Bunya a user agrees to the below terms of conditions of access.**

The terms in this form determine the basic understanding of a user (new or experienced) of the provided file systems and job submission system on University of Queensland owned and operated HPCs such as Bunya. 

* I understand that a basic knowledge of Unix is required to use HPC efficiently. 

* I understand that I should make reasonable effort to learn about Bunya and its efficient and appropriate usage before running calculations on Bunya. The Bunya User Guide can be found here https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs 

* I understand that calculations and resource intensive processes, no matter how quick or small, should not be run on the login nodes. This includes software environment installations (conda, python and R) and compilation (Easybuild, make, cmake etc). They must be run via the queue submission system as a batch or interactive job. 

* I understand that I can use an interactive job submission to run calculations or software installations from the command line and interact with the calculation or software installation if required. 

* I understand that the space provided to me in /scratch/user is for data of current calculations only. It is not backed up and it should not be used to store data. I understand that files that have not been used in 90 days will be automatically deleted without me being notified about this. 

* I understand that the space provided to me in /home is not backed up. 

* I understand that the space provided to me in /QRISdata via the RDM is hierarchical storage including fast disk, slow disk and tape. I understand the implications this will have on access to data in /QRISdata. An overview of RDM usage via HPC is provided via https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs/blob/main/guides/Bunya-UserData-Guide.md#qrisdata. 

* I understand that I should not be running/submitting calculations directly from a directory/folder in /QRISdata. 

* I understand that I should not be continuously reading from and/or writing to a directory/folder in /QRISdata during a calculation. Once-off read of input and/or once-off write of output is acceptable. 

* I understand that Bunya is for academic research use only. Commercial and/or consultation work should not be using Bunya. Teaching work should not be using Bunya.

* I understand that unless personal use is explicitly allowed, software or data licensed to UQ, which includes Open-Source licensed software or data, must only be used for purposes legitimately associated with UQ's operations as a teaching and research institution. By obtaining or using UQ-licensed software or data I must understand and comply with the terms and conditions for use of the software or data.

* I understand that I must not create a tunnel such that I or any other person can connect to or gain access to any information or service inside the Bunya supercomputer via any method not provided by the Research Computing Centre (e.g. via SSH or onBunya). If such functionality is required for my research I may apply for an exemption if all relevant code is provided. 

* ***I understand that violation of any of the above conditions may lead to my access to Bunya being suspended.***
