<br>


1) A Bunya user must have UQ credentials or credentials of a QCIF member institution. Other credentials are not permitted. 

2) A user must use their UQ or QCIF member institution credentials to apply for access to Bunya through the Bunya application process. Requests for access to Bunya will not be considered if made outside of the Bunya application process.  

3) UQ or QCIF member institution credentials do not guarantee access to Bunya. 

4) Applying for Bunya access does not guarantee that access will be granted. 

5) A user must only have one single user account on Bunya. A user with more than one institutional credential, for example a user with student and staff credentials, may only use one of these credentials to gain access to Bunya. In the case where a user is found to have more than one single Bunya user account all Bunya user accounts but one will be disabled in consultation with the user. If a user does not choose within a reasonable time frame, RCC will choose the accounts to disable.  

6) Users must agree to the Bunya Access Conditions (https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs/blob/main/policy/Bunya-Conditions-of-Access.md) and the UQ Conditions of Access to RCC Infrastructure (https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs/blob/main/policy/UQ-Conditions-of-Access-to-RCC-Infrastructure.pdf) when applying for access to Bunya through the Bunya application process. 

7) Bunya users must comply with the Bunya Access Conditions (https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs/blob/main/policy/Bunya-Conditions-of-Access.md) and the UQ Conditions of Access to RCC Infrastructure (https://github.com/UQ-RCC/hpc-docs/blob/main/policy/UQ-Conditions-of-Access-to-RCC-Infrastructure.pdf).  

8) Bunya users should acknowledge their usage of Bunya resources and support in their resulting research output. A suitable acknowledgement is:<br>
*We wish to acknowledge The University of Queensland's Research Computing Centre (RCC) for its support in this research.*
